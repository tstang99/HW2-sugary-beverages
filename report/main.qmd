## Introduction

This is an observational study where data is collected over 30 weeks, from October 27 to May 23, with a follow-up period of 14 days, gathered from two urban hospitals and one suburban hospital. The study employs 5 interventions to help increase the sales of zero-calorie beverages. These interventions include a 10% price discount, a price discount combined with messaging that explains the reason for the discount, messaging displaying the caloric content in sugared beverages, messaging indicating the amount of exercise needed to burn off the calories in a sugared beverage, and messaging containing both caloric content and the amount of physical activity needed.

The study aims to investigate whether these interventions help encourage people to choose zero-calorie beverages over sugared beverages, and if such effects are consistent across hospitals. The statistical question in this context is: "Is there any association between interventions and the increase in zero-calorie beverage sales?"
