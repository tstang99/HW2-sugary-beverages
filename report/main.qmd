## Introduction

Zero calorie beverages are healthier compared to sugared beverages because they contain less sugar and significantly fewer calories. Over the past decades, hospitals have been striving to promote zero-calorie beverages for a healthier lifestyle. This study employs five interventions to help increase such promotion. These interventions include a 10% price discount, a price discount combined with messaging that explains the reason for the discount, messaging displaying the caloric content in sugared beverages, messaging indicating the amount of exercise needed to burn off the calories in a sugared beverage, and messaging containing both caloric content and the amount of physical activity needed.

The study aims to investigate whether these interventions help encourage people to choose zero calorie beverages over sugared beverages and if such effects are consistent across hospitals. The primary statistical question in this context is: "Is there any association between interventions and the increase in zero calorie beverage consumption or decrease in sugary beverage consumption?" The secondary statistical question is:"Does the effect of intervention differs by site?"

## Data description and summaries

This is an experimental design where data are collected over 30 weeks, from October 27 to May 23, with a follow-up period of 14 days, gathered from two urban hospitals and one suburban hospital. During this time period, the sales of different types of drinks are recorded.

| Data Name    | Data Type   | Data Description                       |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Count        | Integer     | The number of days                     |
| DofW         | Categorical | The day of the week, 7 levels          |
| Site         | Categorical | The location of the hospital, 3 levels |
| Intervention | Categorical | The intervention applied, 9 levels     |
| ZeroCal      | Integer     | The number of zero calorie drink sold  |
| Sugary       | Integer     | The number of sugary drink sold        |
| Juice100     | Integer     | The number of Juice100 sold            |
| Ojuice       | Integer     | The number of Ojuice sold              |
| Sports       | Integer     | The number of sports drink sold        |
| Total        | Continuous  | The sum of all drink sold              |

There are missing entries in this dataset, with a significant portion of the missing data attributed to the 'Juice100,' 'Ojuice,' and 'Sports' columns. These columns will not be included in the model because of their irrelevancy, so the missing entries in these columns will not affect the statistical analysis. Additionally, there are seven entirely missing consecutive entries at HF hospital during the follow-up period. This is possible due to the hospital's cafeteria and convenient shop close down for renovation. Apart from these, there are two isolated cases of missing entries. These can be reasonably attributed to temporary closures for public holidays.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(here)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
data <- read_csv(here("rawdata/june1data.csv"))
data <- filter(data, Total > 0) 
data <- data[,-c(7,8,9)]
```

Specific to the statistical questions listed in the introduction, the following exploratory data analysis procedures are suggested. Firstly, in order to address the influence of location on zero-calorie beverage consumption, which is of primary interest to the study, a spaghetti plot is recommended. A spaghetti plot is typically used to demonstrate the change of multiple flows over time and how it varies across the three sites. Meanwhile, it is recommended to use box-plots to approach the primary statistical question concerning the impact of different interventions on zero-calorie and sugary beverage consumption. Box-plots enable a preliminary check of consumption distributions under various interventions. Illustrated below are examples of a spaghetti plot and a box-plots (note that for demonstration purposes, only three interventions are included in the example box-plots).

```{r figs, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7,fig.height=4,fig.cap="\\label{fig:figs}Examples of Recommended EDA Plots"}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
p1=ggplot(data=data, aes(x=Count, y=ZeroCal, color=Site))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
  labs(x="Days of Experiment", y="ZeroCal (bottle)",
       title="The Spaghetti Plot")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5),
        legend.position="bottom")

example_data <- data |> filter(Intervention %in% 
                                 c("cal", "dismes", "preint"))

p2=ggplot(data=example_data, aes(x=Intervention, y=ZeroCal))+
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour="red", outlier.shape=8,
                outlier.size=4)+
  labs(x="Interventions", y="ZeroCal (bottle)",
       title="The Box-plot")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5),
        legend.position="bottom")

plot_grid(p1,p2, ncol=2)
```

Based on the two plots above, it's clear that the time-series data for zero-calorie beverage consumption at site "chop" significantly diverges from the patterns observed at the other two sites, and that the distributions of consumption may vary substantially under different interventions. Additionally, there are two observations. Firstly, the spaghetti plot reveals that except for the beginning period at site "HF", there is no apparent trend at all three sites as the long-term averages seem to be stable. However, strong weekly variations are presented, implying that it is reasonable to include the day of the week (DofW) and to exclude the time (count) in the model. Secondly, the box-plots indicate the presence of many outliers during which the caloric messaging was displayed. However, the clustering nature of these outliers tells valuable information. Therefore, it is advised that outliers be retained in the analysis to reflect the true variability inherent in the intervention's effects.

## Formal analysis

This section outlines general strategies for quantifying and comparing the impacts of five different interventions on the consumption of zero-calorie and sugary beverages across three sites.

It is recommended to implement a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to address the problems. A GLMM, as an extension of the Linear Mixed Model (LMM), can incorporate both fixed and random effects and also accommodate the distribution of the response variable. Specifically, while the fixed effects assess the association of covariates with the response variable across the overall population---serving as a baseline---the random effects account for how some associations may vary across different entities or individuals.

In this study, the primary focus is to analyze the effects of the interventions, and therefore it is suggested to treat the intervention as a fixed effect. Additionally, days of the week should also be considered as a fixed effect because the weekly fluctuation applies to all three sites. To allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the intervention effects, it is advised to include sites and total daily beverage consumption as random effects in the model. These covariates control for variability that might influence the patterns of zero-calorie/sugary beverage consumption. For instance, site differences (which are the secondary statistical question) may impact purchasing behavior due to demographic variations between urban and suburban areas. Similarly, accounting for total daily beverage consumption helps isolate the effect of human traffic on zero-calorie/sugary beverage choices. This comprehensive approach ensures that the analysis accurately reflects the interventions' impact, while controlling for external factors. Last but not least, given that the consumption of ZeroCal beverage is non-negative integer, using an exponential link function to guarantee a positive output is suggested.

Hence, the proposed models are \begin{align*}
ZeroCal & \sim Intervention(Site) + DofW + Total\\
Sugary & \sim Intervention(Site) + DofW + Total,
\end{align*}. Fixed effects are from Intervention, DofW and Total, and random effect measures how the effect of Intervention and baseline of consumption vary across sites. Note that the models are simplified version, especially the omission of link function, and please refer to the appendix for formulated models.

However, there are several limitations to the models mentioned above. Firstly, GLLMs do not accommodate autocorrelation in time series data, which refers to the dependence between consecutive observations. Moreover, the model proposed implicitly assumes that the response variables follow Poisson distributions, where the expectation and variability of response variables should match to each other, but it can be easily violated in practice.

## Conclusions

We recommend using GLMMs to fit the relationship between covariates and response variables. Based on different research interests, response variable should be either ZeroCal beverage consumption or sugary beverage consumption. The fixed-effect explanatory variables suggested are intervention, Total and DofW, and the random-effect explanatory variable is Site.

### Mathematical Formulation of Models

Here a formulation of Generalized Linear Mixed Model under the context of this research is provided. As we suggested above, the random effects can be placed at both slope for intervention and intercept. Taking $response = ZeroCal$ as an example, the model will take the format of

$$
E(zero\_calorie_{ij}) = exp((\beta_0 + b_{0i}) + (\beta_1 + b_{1i}) \;  site + \beta_2 \; Intervention + \beta_3 \; DofW + \beta_4)
$$

where $b_{0i} \sim N(0,\sigma_1)$ and $b_{1i} \sim N(0,\sigma_2)$. Both $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ can be estimated using data, and $zero\_calorie_{ij}$ is assumed to have poisson distribution where its expectation should be equal to its variance. When such an assumption is violated, usually a quasi maximum likelihood estimation is used.
